Always suggest implementations using React Router v7 (formerly Remix).

To write CSS style, we prefer using CSS modules to style layouts and using TailwindCSS to style shapes and colors, so when you suggest styling please follow this manner.

You should follow the directory structure inside `app` directory explained below:

1. UI components are in `components` directory.
2. Domain models are in `models` directory.
3. Business logics are in `services` directory.
4. route modules are in `routes` directory (this is required for React router)
